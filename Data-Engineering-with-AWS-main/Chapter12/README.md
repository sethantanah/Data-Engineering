# Chapter 12 - Visualizing Data with Amazon QuickSight

In this chapter we discussed the power of visually representing data, and then explored core Amazon
QuickSight concepts. We looked at how various data sources can be used with QuickSight,
how data can optionally be imported into the SPICE storage engine, and how you can
perform some data preparation tasks using QuickSight.  

We then did a deeper dive into the concepts of analyses (where new visuals are authored)
and dashboards (published analyses that can be shared with data consumers). As part
of this, we also examined some of the common types of visualizations available in
QuickSight.  

We then looked at some of the advanced features available in QuickSight, including ML
Insights (which uses machine learning to detect outliers in data and forecast future data
trends), as well as embedded dashboards (which enable you to embed either the full
QuickSight console or dashboards directly into your websites and applications).

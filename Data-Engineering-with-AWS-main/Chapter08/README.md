# Chapter 8 - Identifying and Enabling Data Consumers

In this chapter, we explored a variety of data consumers that you are likely to find in most
organizations, including business users, data analysts, and data scientists. We briefly
examined their roles, and then looked at the types of AWS services that each of them is
likely to use to work with data.

## Hands-on Activity
In the hands-on section of this chapter, we took on the role of a data analyst, tasked
with creating a mailing list for the marketing department. We used data that had been
imported from a MySQL database into S3 in a previous chapter, joined two of the tables
from that database, and transformed the data in some of the columns. Then, we wrote the
newly transformed dataset out to Amazon S3 as a CSV file.
